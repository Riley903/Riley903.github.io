# About

This website is a place to display and easily share past work and project I have contributed to over the course of my career. This website will be continuously updated as new achievements are made and as topics I find interesting are shared. See the Blog page for the latest news.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator, and hosted via GitHub with their [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature. I am using the theme built by [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul) under the MIT License. You can view the source code for this website [here](https://github.com/Riley903/Riley903.github.io).
