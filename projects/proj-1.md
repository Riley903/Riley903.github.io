### Introduction

The emergency power system described here was been an ongoing project that has dabbled in system integration, electrical engineering, PCB design, additive manufacturing, programming, mechanical design, and CNC machining.

The results of the project have been for the benefit of my parents, to provide a service that they sometimes have to be without. The development journey however has been more for my benefit since the problems encountered and challenges all have added to my engineering abilities.

#### History

- Why living in East Sooke presents challenges.
- Existing water system.

My father is a retired memeber of the armed forces and air force, and spent the rest of his career in aviation, initially as an AME (Aircraft Maintenance Engineer) and eventually as an inspector in the manufacturing department. He is also one to see value in seemingly worthless things. Because of this, he managed to collect several hundred discarded aircraft battery cells. He managed to aquire these cells due to aviation requirements for battery packs, where if the pack's overall capacity drops below 80% of the rated capacity, the pack is deemed unusable. These packs are generally comprised of 20 cells operating at between 1.2V-1.4V for a total battery voltage of 24V-28V (28V is the de facto standard in aviation for the DC bus). It is often the case that only a few of the 20 cells in the pack are the cause of the pack failing it's 80% capacity test, either by thermal runaway or age, while the rest of the cells are near perfect. Thus when an entire pack is rejected, one can test each individual cell and harvest the usable ones. Such is the way my father managed to aquire several hundred over the course of his career.

I grew up in the middle of the woods at the end of a long winding road in a rural area about an hour drive outside of Victoria British Columbia. During the stormy season, it was not uncommon to be without electrical power when a tree fell across the power lines.
